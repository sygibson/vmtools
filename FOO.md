## Introduction
NetWrangler is a one-shot network interface configuration utility that
is mostly compatible with https://netplan.io configuration files.  Key
differences are:

* It only supports systemd-networkd and old-style Redhat network
  configurations as output formats.  Debian style is a planned on, and
  NetworkManager style is a lower priority.
* No support for configuring wireless interfaces.  This tool is mainly
  intended for servers and other devices that do not have wireless
  interfaces.
* No daemons, dynamic configuration, or other long-lived operations.
  This tool is intended to be run as part of device provisioning,
  where we expect to set the desired network interface config once and
  then forget about it until it is time to reprovision the box.
* No support for hierarchical config files.  We use the netplan.io
  YAML for its schema, not to allow additional layered customization.
* No support for NIC renaming or MAC address reassignment.  Support
  may be added at a later date.
* No support for per-interface backend renderers.  This just doesn't
  seem like a good idea if you don;t care about dynamic interface
  reconfiguration.

## Building NetWrangler

NetWrangler is a Go Lang project, and is simple to build.  Please
install Go version 1.10 or newer (older versions may work but have
not been tested).  See https://golang.org/doc/install

In the future, compiled builds may be provided.

These examples work on Linux or Mac.  You may need to adjust directories
appropriately for your Go environment.  Check out the source code:

```shell
go get github.com/rackn/netwrangler
```

This will checkout the code and (generally) put it in:

`$HOME/go/src/github.com/rackn/netwrangler`

To build it, change to the netwrangler directory and run the build script,
and copy the binary to your path or remote system:

```shell
cd $HOME/go/src/github.com/rackn/netwrangler
tools/build.sh
cp cmd/netwrangler /usr/local/bin
```

## Cross Compiling

Standard Go Lang cross compiling methodology works here, see:
https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment

Example of compiling for Linux 64bit, when on macOS:

`env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 tools/build.sh`

## Contributing

We encourage contributions to help expand and enhance the functionality
of the NetWrangler project.  We operate in a standard "Pull Request" (PR)
git workflow model.  If you have some changes you'd like to make, we
ask that you drop by and chat with us via Slack, sign up at:

https://rackn.com/support/slack/

Please put "netwrangler" in the "I'm interested in" field.

For small fixes and enhancements, please go ahead and submit a PR, with
sufficient comments for us to understand what your intentions are.

If you would like to add a new configuration method (for example, add
full NetworkManager (really? why? :) ) support, please drop us a note
and let us know, we'd appreciate it.

## Input Configuration File Format

The configuration input is via the [netplan.io](https://netplan.io/) DSL.
Please refer to it for full details.
